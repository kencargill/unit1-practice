    <p class="bio">My name is Ken. I'm a hydroponic farmer that used to be a baker. 
        I have an art degree and prefer to make things. I like to knit, take care of sheep and goats, and camp. 
        I have a dog named Teddy and a cat named Pirate.</p>

    <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>

    <p>I first got interested in coding through social media websites in the early 2000s and 2010s. 
        I felt unsure of how to teach myself to code and quickly got distracted by other pursuits. 
        Namely, knitting. I got reintroduced to coding through some programmer friends in the past few years 
        and through my knitting machine. Both of these things made coding approachable for me again and I 
        started playing around with Codecademy and freecodecamp. The farm I currently work on uses a lot of 
        software to control and monitor the farm, this also brought me back to my interest in coding.</p>
    <p>I was introduced to Grand Circus by a close friend of mine who had attended in 2019. 
        I heard a lot about his success and appreciation for the program and decided to give it a shot myself.</p>
